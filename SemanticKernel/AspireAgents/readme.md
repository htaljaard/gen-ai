# Introduction

I created this project to explore the use of agents, including tools and multi agent orchastration with Semantic Kernel. 

While at it, I thought it would be a good idea to keep practicing Aspire to help with container orchastration over Docker-Compose. 

I also wanted to explore Ollama and understand what options we have for OTEL with agents. 

# Tech Stack

- .NET 9
- .NET Aspire 9.3
- Ollama, llama3
- OTEL: Jeager, Prometheus, Graphana

# Getting Started

It is as easy as pressing F5, but Ollama and llama3 take quite a bit of time to start the first time.
